# Welcome To StageFast.

This is a project for the Flatiron School, completed six weeks into the software engineering program. It is not a "real" website -- the actors, productions, studios, and roles are all randomly seeded using data scraped from IMDB.


## Description

The goal of this website is to make it easier for studio managers to cast actors in roles in upcoming productions, without going through agents as the middleman.

Studio representatives are able to create productions, invite actors to audition, and manage who has been cast for each role. They are also able to manage the overall acting budget for a production.

Actors can make a profile page with their profile, headshot, and past roles.
